In this work, we combine Machine learning techniques to identify IoT devices in a network and detect their behavior based on network scanning and network traffic analysis. The network traffic data is used to train models and eliminate non-IoT devices and classify the IoT devices.  Our GradientBooster Classifier algorithm detects and classifies IoT device types with 85% accuracy. Based on IoT normal and malware traffic behavior of each type of IoT device, we use machine learning techniques to identify abnormal behavior of an IoT device based on its type and network traffic associated with the device to create IOT alert notifications. 
Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools automate threat intelligence, asset discovery, attack surface monitoring or security assessments. Spiderfoot is one such OSINT platform. In this work, we combine IoT device type classification, abnormal behavior of IoT device based on its type and generate alert notifications via Spiderfoot integration module to Spiderfoot dashboard about the IoT device.
